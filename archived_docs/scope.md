## Next Version
- Remove Add because of foreign key and key complications for security
- Change to be limited to fields that can be validated
- Delete can stay
- Class Methods can stay
- View can stay
- Templates can stay
- Add ability to glue a function (path scoping will be required)
- Seperate add_glue function into multiple seperate function (glue_view, glue_model etc)
- Compile and minify javascript

## Outstanding Problem

- Unique Name Overlap in Large Projects (Possible solution is to generate names or ids somehow?)
- Maybe needs to be replaced with something else?
